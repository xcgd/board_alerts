Version 1.1.1

* The board alert email template is now defined on "user" objects instead of "board" objects.
This makes the email template more regular; in particular, the "preview" feature works.

Update note: Delete the board alert email template and the board alert cron task before updating.


Version 1.1

* Production release.


Version 1.0.2

* Avoid sending empty tables in alert emails.
